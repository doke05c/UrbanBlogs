##### NYCDensityMapper, Pt. 2 - Discussing the Patterns

##### Using the NYC Density Maps I developed and walked through my creation of in my previous post, I give some thoughts on the patterns--and the changes that should be happening--in New York's density.

##### Midtown's Black Hole
We've all seen it on the street: it's 5 PM. Office workers, hedge fund managers, CEOs, and interns alike walking down 6th Avenue, finding the nearest ten-dollar coffee store or subway entrance. You think, wow, this place really is the financial capital of the world...... if you're a tourist, that is!

Jokes aside, despite being known for its lively business activity in the day, the office district of Manhattan, which comprises this part of Midtown:

![Deadtown GMaps](/assets/images/3_midtowngmaps.png)

is quite dead after the standard work day is over. Come past midnight, and it is almost a dead zone. As Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk pointed out in _Suburban Nation_, having a city be active 24 hours a day, aka be a "24-hour city", is essential to economic and social health, and round-the-clock safety, aka self-policing, which is honestly something we could all use more of in the US. Unfortunately, the housing density of this commercial district looks like this:

#### A near black hole of housing density in what should be New York's densest region.


As housing is essential to maintaining a 24-hour city (no city can ever function round-the-clock if people aren't living there, with some very very specific exceptions like gambling districts or airports), Manhattan's office district is very heavily at risk of being a ghost town at night. Bars, restaurants, and clubs can only be open for so long, usually themselves only until 1 or 2 AM. 

In order to bring this very core area of New York back to life, it is imperative that new housing be offered here, of course, at a wide range of price points to support a diverse economic mix. Especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, many office spaces are sitting around unused, unsold, or worse yet, completely undeveloped. As husks of buildings sit empty and undeveloped in the middle of Manhattan's most prized section of real estate, while people are sleeping rough on the street right outside, one wonders if this is some kind of practical joke. 

Thankfully, there _has_ been incremental movement towards housing in Midtown's office district in recent years, especially seen in the Grand Central Area. The Office of the Mayor of New York City has posted a [statement](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/022-23/mayor-adams-recommendations-convert-underused-offices-homes) on rezoning and redeveloping Midtown's, and other boroughs' office districts for housing, which is ultimately good. 

From the Statement:

"_The Office Adaptive Reuse Task Force was convened by the Adams administration in July 2022 following Local Law 43, sponsored by New York City Councilmember Justin Brannan. The task force’s recommendations include: Expanding the universe of office buildings with the most flexible regulations for conversion to residential use from buildings constructed through 1961 to those constructed through 1990 — easing the potential conversion process for an additional 120 million square feet of office space... Finding opportunities to allow housing, whether through conversions or new construction, in a centrally located, high-density part of Midtown that currently prohibits residential development..._" 

Hopefully this will bring about a quick change to many of the failing 24-hour neighborhoods of New York City, giving them the housing opportunities, and the night life that they deserve.

##### SoHo - Cast in Iron

Beautiful SoHo, the land of transplants, rich tourists, NYU students who don't know any better, and buildings that cost millions to own. After all, it is the vaunted Cast-Iron Historic District! What else could you expect? Except what if I told you that there was a way to own or rent some of these buildings' spaces with almost the exact same interior quality, with identical buildings, identical street culture, in the same exact neighborhood? You would call me insane, until I told you an underrated part of SoHo, the Sullivan-Thompson Historic District.

Let's start with a strange pattern I noticed in the density map in Lower Manhattan. 

![SoHo Density Split, DensityMap](/assets/images/3_sohorender.png)

-Interesting density split in SoHo appears along West Broadway (show render 1)
-https://sohobroadway.org/soho-castironhistoricdistrict-landmarks/
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacDougal%E2%80%93Sullivan_Gardens_Historic_District
-blocks look identical across wbway, what gives? (show pics)
-two rivalling historic districts, one working-class and one more wealthy (relatively speaking, its soho goddamnit) (show render 2)
-important to note many of these buildings that are now considered "upscale" were once part of a fledgling working class art scene from the 70s (essentially these werent always rich trust fund baby playgrounds, and they dont HAVE to be forever!)
-sullivan has multi-unit/floor apts, castiron has only one or two units/floor
-wasted potential for density and activity, more units/floor = more sales at lower prices per unit, more residents = more economic activity = greater community
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoHo,_Manhattan
-current redevelopment plan---????
##### East Side Story
-similarly to soho, UES is split into two regions, also west and east
-western side (5th av to generally around lexington) is labeled historic district from 59 to 79 (above 79 does not concern us) (https://www.nyc.gov/assets/lpc/downloads/pdf/maps/HistoricDistrictMaps/Manhattan/Upper_East_Side.pdf) starting in ~1979-1981 (http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1051.pdf)
-eastern side has no historic protections whatsoever, but this actually isnt as bad as it sounds
-ensuing legal and political battle begins between developers/planners and historic preservation advocates such as civitas (closet NIMBYs, lets be real) in the late 80s over the "avenues" of UES (3rd-1st) (https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/realestate/downscaling-the-avenues-on-the-upper-east-side.html)
-civitas loses the war of attrition (citation needed) and now the eastern upper east side is WILDLY different in character than the western upper east side (show renders + pics)
-WUES is less dense, quieter, more uniform in height (~12-17 fl), almost no business on the streets
-EUES is denser, more active, more engaging to look at due to the height differences (heights can range from 4 to 50 fl), more shops and restaurants
-result? EUES is more affordable (citation needed) and just a better place to explore and have fun in
-once again, hist. designations can help, but we must be careful of preservation becoming stagnation
-we want neighborhoods, not walk-thru museums!
