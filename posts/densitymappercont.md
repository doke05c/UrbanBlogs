##### NYCDensityMapper, Pt. 2 - Discussing the Patterns

##### Using the NYC Density Maps I developed and walked through my creation of in my previous post, I give some thoughts on the patterns--and the changes that should be happening--in New York's density.

#### NYC's residential density mapped by the block level.

### About those Blocks...

##### Midtown's Black Hole
-Office and commerical space dominates Midtown (two screenshots)
-Suffers from usual business district syndrome: area is full of life and activity in the daytime, but by midnight, streets can be dead
-Most of the office space lies unused, especially post-COVID
-This should be replaced with housing
-Mayor Adams & Gov. Hochul are working to cut red tape to build more housing here (poggers) (https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/022-23/mayor-adams-recommendations-convert-underused-offices-homes) (get quotes)

##### SoHo - Cast in Iron
-Interesting density split in SoHo appears along West Broadway (show render 1)
-https://sohobroadway.org/soho-castironhistoricdistrict-landmarks/
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacDougal%E2%80%93Sullivan_Gardens_Historic_District
-blocks look identical across wbway, what gives? (show pics)
-two rivalling historic districts, one working-class and one more wealthy (relatively speaking, its soho goddamnit) (show render 2)
-important to note many of these buildings that are now considered "upscale" were once part of a fledgling working class art scene from the 70s (essentially these werent always rich trust fund baby playgrounds, and they dont HAVE to be forever!)
-sullivan has multi-unit/floor apts, castiron has only one or two units/floor
-wasted potential for density and activity, more units/floor = more sales at lower prices per unit, more residents = more economic activity = greater community
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoHo,_Manhattan
-current redevelopment plan---????
##### East Side Story
-similarly to soho, UES is split into two regions, also west and east
-western side (5th av to generally around lexington) is labeled historic district from 59 to 79 (above 79 does not concern us) (https://www.nyc.gov/assets/lpc/downloads/pdf/maps/HistoricDistrictMaps/Manhattan/Upper_East_Side.pdf) starting in ~1979-1981 (http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1051.pdf)
-eastern side has no historic protections whatsoever, but this actually isnt as bad as it sounds
-ensuing legal and political battle begins between developers/planners and historic preservation advocates such as civitas (closet NIMBYs, lets be real) in the late 80s over the "avenues" of UES (3rd-1st) (https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/realestate/downscaling-the-avenues-on-the-upper-east-side.html)
-civitas loses the war of attrition (citation needed) and now the eastern upper east side is WILDLY different in character than the western upper east side (show renders + pics)
-WUES is less dense, quieter, more uniform in height (~12-17 fl), almost no business on the streets
-EUES is denser, more active, more engaging to look at due to the height differences (heights can range from 4 to 50 fl), more shops and restaurants
-result? EUES is more affordable (citation needed) and just a better place to explore and have fun in
-once again, hist. designations can help, but we must be careful of preservation becoming stagnation
-we want neighborhoods, not walk-thru museums!
