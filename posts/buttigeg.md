-Adressing the hate crimes against Jewish and Muslim people, especially college campuses:

Buttigeg says:
	-we can't step past it
	-biden has been clear on our foreign policy
	-this represents a basic struggle between hate & hope
	-the roots of islamophobia and antisemitism are the same
		-stop hatred
	
	-while we solve these societal issues, its important to take care of the basics (infrastructure and transportation)

Mod Q: How can we interpret the trend of lower car use among younger folks (especially those of hs/college age)? What does this mean as a whole?

Buttigeg says:
	-when he was growing up, everyone was racing to get a license the day they turned 16, car ownership was a must
	-he sees the change as a greater acceptance that cars cannot be the only mode of transport for americans
	-he makes clear that **freedom is about having greater options and choices for transportation**
	-automated (truly automated) vehicles have claimed to have been 7 years away for the last 10 years (basil smikile makes a joke about the knicks or something idk)

On the issue of the **[Transportation Appropriation Bill (2024)](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/bill_summary_-_transportation_housing_and_urban_development_and_related_agencies_fiscal_year_2024_appropriations_bill.pdf)
** currently in Congress: 

Buttigeg says:
	-the bill may be in trouble!
	-the funding for essential projects and maintenance is very low!
		-this shouldn't be controversial: DON'T CUT FUNDING!
		-MORE FUNDING, NOT LESS!
		-reversing the trend of funding of the [Bipartisan Transportation Law (2023)](https://www.transportation.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law) would be a terrible idea

Mod Q: How do we address the need for climate change resiliency in our infrastructure?

Buttigeg says:
	-this shouldn't be up for debate: our infrastructure cannot withstand against climate change, we must bring it up to resiliency standards!
	-he brings up the [Seattle Light Rail shutdown due to sinking tracks](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/severe-shutdown-ahead-for-seattle-light-rail-due-to-sinking-tracks/), and the [I-70 mudslide](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mudslide-scenic-colorado-highway-tests-limits-aging-infrastructure-era-climate-n1278771)
	-[dedicated resilience funding](https://www.georgetownclimate.org/adaptation/toolkits/resilient-infrastructure-investments/what-funding-opportunities-does-iija-offer-for-building-resilience-across-sectors.html) has passed in the [Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (2021)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act)
	-people in congress are far behind on the urgency and obvious reality of climate change
	-in times of crises, we BUILT things. infrastructure projects got us out of the great depression, and it can get us through this tough period as well (read Bold Endeavors by Felix Rodin)

Mod Q: How do we make the link between projects, their construction, and their funding?

Buttigeg says:
	-infrastructure is the LITERAL foundation of our society! (pipes, tunnels, internet!)
	-all things need to be funded, even the things that aren't considered "infrastructure" (by some), such as water pipes, it's more than just bridges and tunnels
	-his favorite kind of fight is where after it's done, nobody believed it could have been any other way (electrification, interstate highways)
	-even small events/projects in as low as six figures, they are still important! they are part of a larger vision
	-"big visions telescope into the particulars of everyday life"
	-infrastructure projects should just work seamlessly and fade into the background. when they don't work, they are the focus of someone's day and they can't focus on any of their other problems
	
Buttigeg says:
	-changing work patterns over covid have made more possibilities for transportation possible, opening up new challenges and possibilities
	-**NOT ALL COMMUTES ARE FOR WORK!**
	-in-person contact is also very important
	-cramming everyone on the same tunnel should be avoided (brings up staggered work days as a solution)

Mod Q: LGA got fixed, GCM/ESA projects opened, we are in a kind of transit renaissance. However, this success depends on state/local government support. How do we cultivate it?

Buttigeg says:
	-building consensus is important! (he got a rep and dem pair of mayors to agree on a bridge across their two towns)
	-sell to your audience, and try to get everyone on board by seeing the benefits of the project
	-as a member of your local community:
		-you can show up to your city council or zoning meeting!
		-make your voice heard!

Mod Q: NYC Congestion Pricing - What are the impacts on communities of color, which often bear the brunt of the pricing? (ex: people putting cars in their neighborhoods rather than in the CBD (central biz district; south ferry to 59th st in nyc), poorer drivers not affording rides to manhattan)

Buttigeg says:
	-the actual decisions need to be made on the city/state level, but the fed gov can ensure that community voices are heard
	-national report texts on this project have community voice sections! (EDITOR'S NOTE: i can't find a source for this)

Audience Q: Everyone seems to not pay attention on the street (looking at phones), what do we do? Is it just a NYC issue or is it a national issue? There are a lot of competing interests on the road? (EDITOR'S NOTE: i think this question sucks, it reduces road design and systemic issues to individual error)

Buttigeg says:
	-**we have a road death crisis.** [40k a year die in traffic deaths](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state)
	-many of those people are what the DoT calls [vulnerable road users](https://highways.dot.gov/sites/fhwa.dot.gov/files/2022-10/VRU%20Safety%20Assessment%20Guidance%20FINAL_508.pdf): pedestrians, cyclists, etc

Audience Q (Abigail Lieber): How can we mitigate climate with the type of transportation that we use? (trains over cars, etc) 

Buttigeg says:
	**-we can't just rely on electric vehicles to get us to net zero emissions!**
	**-we need viable alternatives to cars to make this work**

Audience Q: Amtrak/CA High Speed Rail fail to get essential funding, but Brightline succeeded (to Orlando). How can we use [private sector funds](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/brightline-the-first-private-us-passenger-rail-line-in-100-years-links-miami-and-orlando-at-high-speed/3116767/) to our advantage?
	
Buttigeg says:
	-we need better levels of High Speed Rail!
	-he loves the japanese [shinkansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen) system, we need something too (like [italian HSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_Italy), which is more reasonable)
	-amtrak got $66 billion (EDITOR'S NOTE: it is $22 billion in tangible funds, while it seeks an extra $8 bln, with $36 bln left over for competitive grants, which amtrak is _eligible_ for, but is not currently a winner of, [read here for more](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/amtrak-wants-73-billion-us-funding-infrastructure-projects-2023-06-05/)) in appropriations, but its not enough!
		-we must first restore service, add essential regular speed connections, THEN worry abt HSR
	-we **should** look for creative ways to get funding! private AND public!

Audience Q (David Oke): The strides in federal funding of NYC city center transit projects such as ESA and SAS and Hudson Tubes have been great, but will you provide federal funds for outer borough transit projects like Queenslink/UAS/IBX, whose beneficiaries are more working class?

Buttigeg says:
	-we need to address our burdened communities
	-we need to deal with transit and housing **TOGETHER**, people have to pay for both of those at the same time
	-more transit -> more housing options -> more affordability for all, especially in disadvantaged communities
	-it is harder to get across town (between outer boroughs) than it is to get to manhattan, even for essential services like groceries!
	-frontline community projects are essential
	-federal government does not come up with the plans for these projecs though, locals should come to fed gov with plans, and fed gov gives funding
	-federal money **AND** city/state local money are vital, as are grassroots organizations & local leaders

Buttigeg says (on regulation and passenger rights):
	-"Are class I railroads going to be the next Coke and Pepsi?"
	-**we need railroad regulation** (esp after seeing what happened in east palestine, ohio)
	-we need passenger protections, provide them a higher level of service, refund them for transgressions, limit shady tactics from air and rail liners
	-we have record highs of passenger rights! (EDITOR'S NOTE: CITATION NEEDED)

Audience Q: People are still on their phones in Amsterdam and Seoul, and people aren't being killed in car accidents as much. This is a design safety issue! We need more pedestrian safety! SUVs and cybertrucks are terrible for ped. safety! How do we address pedestrian deaths systematically?

Buttigeg says:
	-we tolerate carnage in the USA, this **shouldn't be the cost of business**
	-we need safer vehicle speeds (lower)
	-**reducing lane widths and lane count (like he did in south bend, indiana!) not only make streets safer, it also SPEEDS UP TRAFFIC! who would have thought! (**EDITOR'S NOTE: yes pete, we love induced demand <3)
	-it is time to expand vehicle safety standards to include pedestrian deaths, and legally enforce car manufacturers to make sure their vehicles are safer for pedestrian collisions (EDITORS NOTE: missed opportunity to advocate policy for tightening regulations on SUV design)
	-fancy tech won't stop cars from running into pedestrians, and **WE CAN'T TRUST IT TO!**
