##### Inequity in NYC, Part 1: CitiBike to the Boroughs!
##### On January 4th, CitiBike hiked their fares by 10-20%. Will this price increase reflect better service for outer borough, working class communities, or will CitiBike remain a toy bikeshare system for the well-connected class?

##### December 15, 2023: 6:30 PM, Brooklyn Bridge, NYC:

A swift breeze against my face sends my bangs flying behind my forehead, the lapels of my jacket in as many directions as their tiny flaps can go. My eyes were on the brink of tearing up, but the wind isn't blowing against me because of the weather. I'm cruising uphill through the Brooklyn Bridge at 15 miles an hour (24 kph) on an electric CitiBike, absorbing the breathtaking views of the nearby Manhattan Bridge and the Midtown Manhattan skyline without thinking for a moment about putting work into pedaling. I rejoice with my friend as we see the cars on our right side fall away behind us, succumbing to the traffic of their own creation while we speed ahead on a clear bike path, as if an urbanist Moses himself split the Red Bridge in two to make room for cyclists like us. "**WE'RE FASTER THAN THE CARS!!!**", he screams in exhilaration, trying to make sure the words don't fly away before they can extend behind him to reach my ears.

*We were indeed faster than the cars.*<br>
We reach Prospect Park in 28 minutes.

A similar trip on the subway would have taken at least 30 minutes with a transfer.

It would have taken anywhere between 20 and 40 minutes depending on traffic at the time.

Ever since I moved to Manhattan for college and bought my CitiBike membership in September, transit hasn't been any easier. Getting places used to be an exercise in running for a train, waiting for it when it's late, stuffing myself into it when it's packed, or otherwise bending life to its schedule. Now, I can enjoy a more peaceful, convenient commute, with (somewhat) pretty views (depending on where I'm going). This is especially true in my case, as my dorm is at least a 15-minute walk from the nearest subway station, and CitiBike has been nothing but helpful in simplifying either the entire trip, or just the last three-quarter mile stretch home. Not needing to worry about parking a bicycle or locking it or having it stolen or damaged in any way is a major benefit as well, and is only something that can be achieved with a strong bike-share system. Speaking of strong bike-share systems, it's also pretty expansive, allowing me to get to most of my destinations within the network, like school, a library, the grocery store, or a nearby friend. 

Expansive? You must be joking.

It would be a flawless bike-share system, and I could end the article right here, if I were actually serious about that "expansive" bit. If anyone lives ***anywhere*** in the city that isn't in the ring of posh, wealthy, privileged New York, they would know what I'm talking about.

This map of today's CitiBike coverage in New York may look like good news. Look, it even covers New Jersey!

But let me remind you what New York actually looks like.

Most of the city's area is left completely dry by the service, despite having been up (and to its credit, expanding!) since 2013. Expansion has historically followed a radial pattern, beginning in Manhattan's Central Business District, and fanning out.
